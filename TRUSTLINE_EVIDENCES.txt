DO YOU UNDERSTAND SIMPLE ENGLISH OR NOT.

I HAVE TOLD YOU IN  MY PREVIOUS MAILS THAT YOU HAVE NOT RESPONDED TO ALL MY MAIL TRAILS.

YOU ARE HIDING THE SEBI's and TRUSTLINE's CEO's NAME AND CONTACT DETAILS.

WHEN YOU SENT ME THE POLICY DOCUMENT DID YOU VERIFY THAT ALL THE PAGES WERE INTACT, THERE ARE  pages MISSING FROM IT, THEY ARE PAGES 7, 8, 13 and 14.

WHY IS MY ACCOUNT WITH YOU IN THE SUSPENDED MODE IF ALL WAS WELL?

IF YOU WANT ME TO STOP SENDING YOU  YOU REMINDERS  THEN PROVIDE ME SEBI AND YOUR CEO's Email and contact details  so that I can take my case  further.

    Hi RDCC,

    Can you forward me the last email that you emailed me where you said you would take legal action against me and place the cost of bearing the cost of the legal process taken up by you  for writing to you repeatedly for my complaints about Sailender Jain and his cheating case.

    I need to inform SEBI about it and ask them if it was as per SEBI rules?

Subject: N61029:: I have been complaining to TRUSTLINE for the last 2.5 years about Sailendra Jain.

Hi HelpDesk,

Today I called up TRUSTLINE to complain about unauthorized trading
done by Sailendra Jain on my account. My call was forwared to
Compliance Department to Amit Goal, I was tols there that he was not
on seat, The responser there said he will pass the message to Amit and
Amit has not got back to me.


This is the same thing is being done by Vivek Saxena, who promised to
look into this case and get back to me on June 27,2013 and he has not
done so, when I contacted TRUSTLINE again, via email and phone he has
been dodging.

Sailendra is a cheat, a fraudster using your company name to cheat
people like me.

You say that  you have been sending the ledgers, I never complained
about them, ALL TRADES DONE ON MY ACCOUNT WERE UNAUTHORIZED TRADINGS
DONE BY SAILENDRA JAIN.HE TOLS LIES THAT HE WILL TRADE AND EARN AT THE
RATE OF 3-5% per month and max 10% per month.

YOU CAN SEE MY ACCOUNT IS IN THE SUSPENDED MODE and HE WAS TRING TO
GET SOME PAPER SIGNED BY ME, HE HAD SENT HIS GUNDA TO MY HOUSE TO GET
THEM SIGNED.

AMIT CAN YOU LOOK INTO THIS.


In case you cannot do anything, then please send me SEBI's EMAIL ID
and MUKESH KANSAL'S EMAIL ID AND PHONE NUMBER.

I WAS THREATENED BY TRUSTLINE THAT YOU WILL TAKE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST
ME, PLEASE TAKE A LEGAL ACTION AGAIN ME, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?
Regards,

Pinki Roy

    Hi,

    Can you transfer the remaining cash in my account(Rs 102.92) to my registered online account?

    Mr Sailendra Jain along with Sham have done illegal trading and reduced my account balance from Rs4.55L to Rs 102.92.I brought this to your notice in Feb 2011.

Hi HelpDesk/RDCC/Amit,

You say Sailendra Jain in my Relation Ship Manager. So what are his duties and responsibilities towards ahis client?

Is this also an illegal question that I am asking you?

Or is it cheat and defaud his clients? I have asked him several times which scheme he introduced me to...he is keeping silent like a cheat, fraudster and on top of that after complaining to you,  you all are acting in the same lines.

So can you give me the Contact details of CEO of Trust Line and SEBI?


Regards,
Pinki Roy

Hi SANJAY,

I need some clarifications from you:-
 
1.Who is my  Relationship Manager and what are his duties towards me as per policy?

2.Was he supposed to trade on my account, if yes can you send me scanned copies of such documents.

3. Can you send me the scanned copies of the documents that Sailendra and Shyam got signed from me by telling me lies and breaking my trust in your company of 20 years and company which has received many accolades and prizes?

4.I have written to Sailendra Jain several times requesting him to return my money but he prefers to keep silent as he has seen that I have caught his crime and criminal activities.
  

5.In case you are not able to recover my Ra 4.55L with interest since 2010, please let me know where to complain and get my money receoverd.

6. You can see how much disturbed SAILENDRA JAIN  has made me.


Sailendra: Let me know if you have any concerns.
